# basicgrep
## About
I was going through an old Rust book and there was an excersise for making a basic grep program. This follows the same general methodologies of the excersice, but is expanded upon to support flags and more complex grep functionalities, like reading from multiple files and regex support.

## How to Use
Clone, build, and run the compiled program.
